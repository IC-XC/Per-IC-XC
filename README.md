- 👋 Hi, I’m Per. I live in Belgium, Europe. 
- 🗺 In these repertories you will find some projects I have been working.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning essential coding skills and become one of the few designers in the industry who can speak the developer’s language.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript. I am familiar with the most common HTML elements and I can work with CSS. So I know how an HTML document is put together, how to make hyperlinks, lists, tables, forms, etc. correct. I know how to style an element and an entire document. I have already gained some experience with programming and terms such as variables, operators, statements, loops, strings, arrays, objects,... sound familiar to me.
- 🐍 My next step is to learn Python for Data Analysis.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with a team of innovative professionals who are dedicated to their profession.
